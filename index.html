      <div class="section">This is an adventure game.<br>
        You can play on your own, with friends, or on a server.
        <p> Watch out it is highly addictive, as I have played over 1,700 hours.
        </p>
        <p>Terraria is most widely acquired via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/"

            target="_blank">Steam</a> and is well worth the price tag, unless on
          console, I recommend you play with <strong>keyboard and mouse!</strong></p>

      <div class="section">The first thing you will need to do is collect some
        wood, use the Copper Axe that is item 3 in your hotbar (although can be
        changed), and chop down a tree. <br>
        collect the wood, and then you are going to be ready to do some
        crafting. <br>
        Press escape and then craft yourself a WorkBench. <br>
        Place down the workbench and then craft the required items for a valid
        housing<em> </em>(housing suitable for an NPC)<em>. <br>

      <div class="section">Once you have made your first valid housing you will
        want to make more.<br>
        <b>Why?</b> <br>
        Well each of the NPCs (That is non-Player Characters)will need their own
        living space, which has to be a valid housing. And as you advance
        through the game your are going to unlock more and more NPCs.<br>
        <b>What next?</b><br>
        You are ready to explore, so some things you need to know<br>
        <br>
        <b><u>Night Time</u></b><br>
        Oh yes, when night falls and you are new to the game, you are going to
        want to keep yourself safe from Zombies and other nightly creatures
        (Hostile mobs that spawn at night). So it's best to close yourself into
        a Home or Cave on your first night, you will need torches and some wood
        to do this quickly. Do not worry too much about a door, just block
        yourself in and you can cut your way out in the morning. <br>
        However, night time need not be wasted, you can mine quite safely as
        long as you keep yourself blocked off from the Zombies. And as you
        collect new materials you will be able to craft your first items. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Torches</b> require wood and Gel , you collect the Gel each time you
        defeat a slime (easiest in the day time, because they only spawn in day
        time, but hang around through the night just hopping about).<br>
        <b>Tools</b> you are best to collect materials like metal ore (which you
        need to smelt in a furnace) and then make metal tools. Note you can also
        make pretty decent tools out of Cactus if you find you are close to the
        desert.<br>
        <b>Weapons</b> are fashioned in a similar way to tools and the Cactus
        Sword is highly recommended as a much more effective weapon that the
        copper short sword that you got in your starter pack.<br>
        <b>Armour</b> is pretty important too!!! If you like to stay alive for
        longer, then craft some armour out of available materials and put it on
        (menu is located toward the right of your screen when having your
        inventory open). You will find as you go through the game that items
        made from better materials give more protection, and some complete sets
        give a whole set Buff (increase in certain stat or some form of bonus).<br>
        <b>Health</b> is always running down when we get attacked, injured,
        poisoned, or fall from too great a height. Keep healing potions that you
        find in Vases and Chests handy, and press the 'H' (every keybind can be
        rebound to anything you like!) key to heal.<br>
        <b>Chests</b> are all around the world, right-click a chest to open it
        and see what is inside, loot it and then mine the chest to take back to
        your base for storing all your treasure and materials, because whilst a
        40 slot inventory seems large, it soon gets full. <br>
        <b>Vases</b> are plentiful and all over the surface and underground,
        smash them with Axe or Sword and collect the goodies from inside, these
        include Rope, Torches, Coins, Bombs, some weapons and Ammunition. They
        are a quick way to collect immediately needed materials. <br>
        <b>Acorns</b> you are collecting a lot of wood, chopping down a lot of
        trees, but please be responsible and replant the acorns, this will
        prevent the world becoming barren and provide plenty more wood when you
        need it later. <br>
        <b>Mining</b> by far the fastest way to progress in Terraria is to avoid
        spending pointless hours/days mining, but it is good fun, so I advise to
        run across the surface and access the underground where possible, via
        existing entrances and caves, and mine when you need to in order to make
        progress, collect materials and to avoid dangerous mobs. <br>
