      <div class="section">The first thing you will need to do is collect some
        wood, use the Copper Axe that is item 3 in your hotbar, and chop down a
        tree. <br>
        collect the wood, and then you are going to be ready to do some
        crafting. <br>
        Press escape and then craft yourself a WorkBench. <br>
        Place down the workbench and then craft the required items</div>

      <div class="section">Once you have made your first valid housing you will
        want to make more.<br>
        <b>Why?</b> <br>
        Well each of the NPCs (That is non-Player Characters)will need their own
        living space, which has to be a valid housing. And as you advance
        through the game your are going to unlock more and more NPCs <br>
        <b>What next?</b><br>
        You are ready to explore, so som ethings you need to know<br><br>
        <b><u>Night Time</u></b><br>
        Oh yes, when night falls and you are new to the game, you are going to want to keep yourself safe from Zombies and other nighly creatures.  So it's best to close yourself into a Home or Cave on your first night, you will need torches and some wood to do this quickly.  Do not worry too much about a door, just block yourself in and you can cut your way out in the morning. <br>
        However, night time need not be wasted, you can mine quite safely as long as you keep yourself blocked off from the Zombies.  And as you collect new materials you will be able to craft your first items. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Torches</b> require wood and Gel, you collect the Gel each time you defeat a slime (easiest in the day time, and the guide will kill some for you)<br>
        <b>Tools</b> you ar ebest to collect materials like metal ore (which you need to smelt in a furnace) and then make metal tools.  Note you can also make pretty decent tools out of Cactus if you fin dyou are close to the desert.<br>
        <b>Weapons</b> are fashioned in a similar way to tools and the Cactus Sword is highly recommended as a much more effective weapon that the copper short sword that you got in your starter pack.<br>
        <b>Armour</b> is pretty importnat too!!! if you like to stay alive for longer then craft some armour out of available materials and put it on.  You will find as you go through the game that items made from better materials give more protection, and some complete sets give a whole set Buff.<br>
        <b>Health</b> is always running down when we get attacked, injured, poisened, or fall from too great a height.  Keep healing potions that you find in Vases and Chests handy, and press the 'H' key to heal.<br>
        <b>Chests</b> are all around the world, right-click a chest to open it and see what is inside,  Loot it and then mine the Chest to take back to your base for storing allm your treasure and materials, because whilst a 40 slot inventory seems large, it soon gets full. <br>
        <b>Vases</b> are plentiful and all over the surface and underground, smash them with Axe or Sword and collect the goodies from inside, these include Rope, Torches, Coins, Bombs, some weapons and Ammunition.  They are a quick way to collect immediately needed materials. <br>
        <b>Acorns</b> you are collecting a lot of wood, chopping down a lot of treas, but please be responsible and replant the acorns, this will prevent the world becoming barren and provide plenty more wood when you need it latter. <br>
        <b>Mining</b> by far the fastest way to progress in Terraria is to avoid spending pointlee hours/days mining, but it is good fun, so I advise run across the surface and access the underground where possible via existing entrances and caves, and mine when you need to in order to make progress, collect materials and to avoid dangerous mobs <br>
